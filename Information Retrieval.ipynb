Michael’s work at the Bingham Centre involves educating young people across the world about democracy and human rights. He recently created an online course, 'Citizenship and the Rule of Law', which over 5,000 students have participated in thus far.  He is the Coordinator of 'The Rule of Law for Citizenship Education', a UK-wide programme for secondary school students. As a result of the success of this work, Michael was asked to join the Solicitor General's Public Legal Education Committee in 2017. He was a co-author of the minister's vision statement in 2018.\n",

      "           In the last few years Michael has contributed to several public inquiries relating to areas of his research. The bodies conducting these inquiries have frequently cited his evidence in producing final recommendations for government decision makers, including the House of Commons Justice Select Committee inquiry into reform of courts and tribunals , the Draft Commissioner for Children and Young People (Jersey) Law 201- Scrutiny review - Care of Children in Jersey Review Panel and the final report of the House of Lords Ad Hoc Select Committee on Citizenship and Civic Engagement.\n",

      "           Michael began his career as a community organiser encouraging young people and disenfranchised groups to participate in public life. He has led voter registration projects that have successfully registered hundreds of thousands of first-time voters, working with the Cabinet Office and other partners to promote voter engagement in the run-up to the 2016 European Union Referendum. The University of Nottingham gave Michael an 'Alumni Laureate Award' to recognise his democratic engagement work and he was named a (fee-waiving) Fellow of the Royal Society of the Arts in 2017.\n",
